/// The `Worker` trait provides a blueprint for creating and managing asynchronous workers.
/// Each worker must implement the `run` method, defining the worker's processing logic.
///
/// The trait includes a default `spawn` method for creating and running an instance
/// of the worker asynchronously within a Tokio runtime. The `spawn` method returns a
/// `WorkerHandle`, which can be used to manage the lifecycle of the spawned worker.

/// A handle for managing and interacting with a worker task.
///
/// The `WorkerHandle<T>` struct provides a way to handle an asynchronous task
/// (or worker) which performs background operations. It wraps a Tokio `JoinHandle`
/// and uses a `PhantomData<T>` to associate the handle with a generic worker type.
